## Quick Installation

### Quick Setup for Ubuntu/VPS

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine && cd rengine
    ```

1. Configure the environment

    ```bash
    nano .env
    ```

    **Ensure you change the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` for security.**

1. (Optional) For non-interactive install, set admin credentials in `.env`

    ```bash
    DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME=yourUsername
    DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL=YourMail@example.com
    DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=yourStrongPassword
    ```
    If you need to carry out a non-interactive installation, you can setup the login, email and password of the web interface admin directly from the .env file (instead of manually setting them from prompts during the installation process). This option can be interesting for automated installation (via ansible, vagrant, etc.).

    * `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME`: web interface admin username (used to login to the web interface).

    * `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL`: web interface admin email.

    * `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`: web interface admin password (used to login to the web interface).

1. Adjust Celery worker scaling in `.env`

    ```bash
    MAX_CONCURRENCY=80
    MIN_CONCURRENCY=10
    ```

    `MAX_CONCURRENCY`: This parameter specifies the maximum number of reNgine's concurrent Celery worker processes that can be spawned. In this case, it's set to 80, meaning that the application can utilize up to 80 concurrent worker processes to execute tasks concurrently. This is useful for handling a high volume of scans or when you want to scale up processing power during periods of high demand. If you have more CPU cores, you will need to increase this for maximised performance.

    `MIN_CONCURRENCY`: On the other hand, MIN_CONCURRENCY specifies the minimum number of concurrent worker processes that should be maintained, even during periods of lower demand. In this example, it's set to 10, which means that even when there are fewer tasks to process, at least 10 worker processes will be kept running. This helps ensure that the application can respond promptly to incoming tasks without the overhead of repeatedly starting and stopping worker processes.

    These settings allow for dynamic scaling of Celery workers, ensuring that the application efficiently manages its workload by adjusting the number of concurrent workers based on the workload's size and complexity.

    Here is the ideal value for `MIN_CONCURRENCY` and `MAX_CONCURRENCY` depending on the number of RAM your machine has:

    * 4GB: `MAX_CONCURRENCY=10`
    * 8GB: `MAX_CONCURRENCY=30`
    * 16GB: `MAX_CONCURRENCY=50`

    This is just an ideal value which developers have tested and tried out and works! But feel free to play around with the values.
    Maximum number of scans is determined by various factors, your network bandwidth, RAM, number of CPUs available. etc

1. Run the installation script:

    ```bash
    sudo ./install.sh
    ```

    For non-interactive install: `sudo ./install.sh -n`

    *Note: If needed, run `chmod +x install.sh` to grant execution permissions.*

**reNgine can now be accessed from <https://127.0.0.1> or if you're on the VPS <https://your_vps_ip_address>**

**Unless you are on development branch, please do not access reNgine via any ports**
