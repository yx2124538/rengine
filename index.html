<p>ü¶æ&nbsp;&nbsp; reNgine has advanced reconnaissance capabilities, harnessing a range of open-source tools to deliver a comprehensive web application reconnaissance experience. With its intuitive User Interface, it excels in subdomain discovery, pinpointing IP addresses and open ports, collecting endpoints, conducting directory and file fuzzing, capturing screenshots, and performing vulnerability scans. To summarize, it does end-to-end reconnaissance. With WHOIS identification and WAF detection, it offers deep insights into target domains. Additionally, reNgine also identifies misconfigured S3 buckets and find interesting subdomains and URLS, based on specific keywords to helps you identify your next target, making it a go-to tool for efficient reconnaissance.</p>
<p>üóÉÔ∏è&nbsp; &nbsp; Say goodbye to recon data chaos! reNgine seamlessly integrates with a database, providing you with unmatched data correlation and organization. Forgot the hassle of grepping through json, txt or csv files. Plus, our custom query language lets you filter reconnaissance data effortlessly using natural language like operators such as filtering all alive subdomains with <code>http_status=200</code> and also filter all subdomains that are alive and has admin in name <code>http_status=200&amp;name=admin</code></p>
<p>üîß&nbsp;&nbsp; reNgine offers unparalleled flexibility through its highly configurable scan engines, based on a YAML-based configuration. It offers the freedom to create and customize recon scan engines based on any kind of requirement, users can tailor them to their specific objectives and preferences, from thread management to timeout settings and rate-limit configurations, everything is customizable. Additionally, reNgine offers a range of pre-configured scan engines right out of the box, including Full Scan, Passive Scan, Screenshot Gathering, and the OSINT Scan Engine. These ready-to-use engines eliminate the need for extensive manual setup, aligning perfectly with reNgine&#39;s core mission of simplifying the reconnaissance process and enabling users to effortlessly access the right reconnaissance data with minimal effort.</p>
<p>üíé&nbsp;&nbsp;Subscans: Subscan is a game-changing feature in reNgine, setting it apart as the only open-source tool of its kind to offer this capability. With Subscan, waiting for the entire pipeline to complete is a thing of the past. Now, users can swiftly respond to newfound discoveries during reconnaissance. Whether you&#39;ve stumbled upon an intriguing subdomain and wish to conduct a focused port scan or want to delve deeper with a vulnerability assessment, reNgine has you covered.</p>
<p>üìÉ&nbsp;&nbsp; PDF Reports: In addition to its robust reconnaissance capabilities, reNgine goes the extra mile by simplifying the report generation process, recognizing the crucial role that PDF reports play in the realm of end-to-end reconnaissance. Users can effortlessly generate and customize PDF reports to suit their exact needs. Whether it&#39;s a Full Scan Report, Vulnerability Report, or a concise reconnaissance report, reNgine provides the flexibility to choose the report type that best communicates your findings. Moreover, the level of customization is unparalleled, allowing users to select report colors, fine-tune executive summaries, and even add personalized touches like company names and footers. With GPT integration, your reports aren&#39;t just a report, with remediation steps, and impacts, you get 360-degree view of the vulnerabilities you&#39;ve uncovered.</p>
<p>üîñ&nbsp; &nbsp; Say Hello to Projects! reNgine 2.0 introduces a powerful addition that enables you to efficiently organize your web application reconnaissance efforts. With this feature, you can create distinct project spaces, each tailored to a specific purpose, such as personal bug bounty hunting, client engagements, or any other specialized recon task. Each projects will have separate dashboard and all the scan results will be separated from each project, while scan engines and configuration will be shared across all the projects.</p>
<p>‚öôÔ∏è&nbsp; &nbsp; Roles and Permissions! In reNgine 2.0, we&#39;ve taken your web application reconnaissance to a whole new level of control and security. Now, you can assign distinct roles to your team members‚ÄîSys Admin, Penetration Tester, and Auditor‚Äîeach with precisely defined permissions to tailor their access and actions within the reNgine ecosystem.</p>
<ul>
<li>üîê Sys Admin: Sys Admin is a superuser that has permission to modify system and scan related configurations, scan engines, create new users, add new tools etc. Superuser can initiate scans and subscans effortlessly.</li>
<li>üîç Penetration Tester: Penetration Tester will be allowed to modify and initiate scans and subscans, add or update targets, etc. A penetration tester will not be allowed to modify system configurations.</li>
<li>üìä Auditor: Auditor can only view and download the report. An auditor can not change any system or scan related configurations nor can initiate any scans or subscans.</li>
</ul>
<p>üöÄ&nbsp;&nbsp; GPT Vulnerability Report Generation: Get ready for the future of penetration testing reports with reNgine&#39;s groundbreaking feature: &quot;GPT-Powered Report Generation&quot;!

<h2>Quick Installation</h2>
<h3>Quick Setup for Ubuntu/VPS</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Clone the repository</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git clone https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine &amp;&amp; cd rengine
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Configure the environment</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">nano .env
</code></pre>
<p> <strong>Ensure you change the <code>POSTGRES_PASSWORD</code> for security.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>(Optional) For non-interactive install, set admin credentials in <code>.env</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME=yourUsername
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL=YourMail@example.com
DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=yourStrongPassword
</code></pre>
<p> If you need to carry out a non-interactive installation, you can setup the login, email and password of the web interface admin directly from the .env file (instead of manually setting them from prompts during the installation process). This option can be interesting for automated installation (via ansible, vagrant, etc.).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME</code>: web interface admin username (used to login to the web interface).</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL</code>: web interface admin email.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD</code>: web interface admin password (used to login to the web interface).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Adjust Celery worker scaling in <code>.env</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">MAX_CONCURRENCY=80
MIN_CONCURRENCY=10
</code></pre>
<p> <code>MAX_CONCURRENCY</code>: This parameter specifies the maximum number of reNgine&#39;s concurrent Celery worker processes that can be spawned. In this case, it&#39;s set to 80, meaning that the application can utilize up to 80 concurrent worker processes to execute tasks concurrently. This is useful for handling a high volume of scans or when you want to scale up processing power during periods of high demand. If you have more CPU cores, you will need to increase this for maximised performance.</p>
<p> <code>MIN_CONCURRENCY</code>: On the other hand, MIN_CONCURRENCY specifies the minimum number of concurrent worker processes that should be maintained, even during periods of lower demand. In this example, it&#39;s set to 10, which means that even when there are fewer tasks to process, at least 10 worker processes will be kept running. This helps ensure that the application can respond promptly to incoming tasks without the overhead of repeatedly starting and stopping worker processes.</p>
<p> These settings allow for dynamic scaling of Celery workers, ensuring that the application efficiently manages its workload by adjusting the number of concurrent workers based on the workload&#39;s size and complexity.</p>
<p> Here is the ideal value for <code>MIN_CONCURRENCY</code> and <code>MAX_CONCURRENCY</code> depending on the number of RAM your machine has:</p>
<ul>
<li>4GB: <code>MAX_CONCURRENCY=10</code></li>
<li>8GB: <code>MAX_CONCURRENCY=30</code></li>
<li>16GB: <code>MAX_CONCURRENCY=50</code></li>
</ul>
<p> This is just an ideal value which developers have tested and tried out and works! But feel free to play around with the values.
 Maximum number of scans is determined by various factors, your network bandwidth, RAM, number of CPUs available. etc</p>
</li>
<li><p>Run the installation script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo ./install.sh
</code></pre>
<p> For non-interactive install: <code>sudo ./install.sh -n</code></p>
<p> <em>Note: If needed, run <code>chmod +x install.sh</code> to grant execution permissions.</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
